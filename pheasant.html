		<div>The male ring-necked pheasant is easy to spot, with its showy iridescent plumage and rooster-like call. They are common to Calgary’s urban parks, especially Fish Creek Provincial Park. They live in southern Alberta year-round, preferring grasslands, river valleys and coulees.
Here are five things about this
fascinating bird.

		<div>Jansen has been one of the most vocal critics within PC ranks of Jason Kenney. The former television journalist served in Alison Redford’s cabinet as associate minister of family and community safety. Known for her advocacy of LGBTQ and other social issues, she has been criticized in conservative circles for her support of Liberal candidate Kent Hehr in the last federal election.</div>

		<div>They’re not from around here
</div>
		<div>Ring-necked pheasants were actually introduced to North America from China and Japan in the late 1880s. They arrived in the Strathmore area in 1908, where the population built up slowly. By the 1930s, they were well-established in the Brooks area.
Globally, it’s one of the most
hunted birds. They are bred
to be hunted and are shot
in great numbers in
Europe. Pheasant
farming is popular,
especially in the U.K.
</div>
		<div>Moms ‘speak’ to their chicks
</div>
		<div>Pheasant hens communicate with their chicks even before they hatch. The hens chirp to their eggs while incubating. This allows the chicks to recognize their mother’s voice as soon as they hatch and it trains them to respond to her calls when they
leave the nest. Generally, they
leave the nest three weeks
after hatching.
</div>
		<div>Thanks to a healthy store of fat, the pheasant is able to ride out a blizzard for up to three days. Still, the biggest cause of winter mortality is freezing, when the bird loses more heat than it can produce. This is why good winter habitat is essential to the bird's
survival. The pheasant finds
cover under dense
vegetation, which also
provides sanctuary
from coyotes and
birds of prey.
</div>
		<div>They’re tough birds
</div>
		<div>They’re good breeders
</div>
		<div>In optimal conditions, a single hen may lay more than 30 eggs in a breeding season. Many of those eggs are laid before she has even built a nest. Once a nest is built, the hen will lay one egg a day until it’s full with 10 or 12. The
hen then starts incubating,
spending up to 23 hours a
day on the nest, taking short
breaks to feed. The eggs
usually hatch after
23 days.
</div>
		<div>The Alberta Conservation Program
will release 26,000 pheasants over 41 sites this year. It’s the third year of the release program, which is intended to revive pheasant hunting in Alberta — once a prime hunting destination for the bird.
